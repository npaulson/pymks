MKS
~~~

The Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) is a novel data science approach
for solving multiscale materials science problems. It uses techniques
from physics, machine learning, regression analysis, signal processing,
and spatial statistics to create processing-structure-property
relationships. The MKS carries the potential to bridge multiple length
scales using localization and homogenization linkages, and provides a
data driven framework for solving inverse material design problems.

PyMKS
~~~~~

The Materials Knowledge Materials in Python (PyMKS) framework is an
object-oriented set of tools and examples, written in Python, that
provide high-level access to the MKS framework for rapid creation and
analysis of structure-property-processing relationships. A short
introduction to how to use PyMKS is outlined below and example cases can
be found `in the examples section <EXAMPLES.html>`__. Both code and
examples contributions are welcome.

Binder
------

There are a number of `live example notebooks on
Binder <http://mybinder.org/repo/materialsinnovation/pymks>`__ to help
you get started with PyMKS.

Docker
------

The `Dockerfile <Dockerfile>`__ is for Binder, but can be used locally.
See `ADMINISTRATA.md <ADMINISTRATA.md>`__ for more details. The official
PyMKS instance is at https://hub.docker.com/r/wd15/pymks/.

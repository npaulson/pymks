Bulk Metallic Glass Metal Matrix Composites
===========================================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses a data set from directionally aligned bulk metallic
glass metal matrix compite. These materials have low ductility and good
fatigue strength for more information about the dataset see `this
paper <https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0809000106>`__.

The BMG-MMC in this data set is directionally solidified BMG-MMC which
through the use of electromagnets the crystalline phases are aligned
within the amorphous matrix. In this example we will be applying commons
tools used throughout PyMKS in order to classify the micostructures and
hopefully observe degrees of anisotropy throughout the microstructures.

.. code:: python

    %matplotlib inline
    %load_ext autoreload
    %autoreload 2
    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


.. parsed-literal::

    The autoreload extension is already loaded. To reload it, use:
      %reload_ext autoreload


Load in the Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from pymks_share import DataManager
    manager = DataManager('pymks.me.gatech.edu')
    X = manager.fetch_data('metallic glass')


Lets look at the Microstructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below we can see one of the microstructures. We can easily discern the
phases of the

.. code:: python

    from pymks.tools import draw_microstructures
    
    
    print(X.shape)
    draw_microstructures(X[::54 / 3])



.. parsed-literal::

    (54, 480, 640)

Now let's crop the images to remove the metadata and scale bar at the
bottom so that they don't affect our 2-point statistics calculations.

.. code:: python

    X_crop = X[:, 150:400, 150:400]
    draw_microstructures(X_crop[::54 / 3])




.. image:: metallic_glass_files/metallic_glass_7_0.png


.. code:: python

    from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu, rank
    
    
    ostu_values = np.array([threshold_otsu(x) for x in X_crop])
    X_seg = X > ostu_values[:, None, None]


.. code:: python

    draw_microstructures(X_seg[:: 54 / 3])

Data Reductive Techniques
-------------------------

We still have a huge data set! We could either compare each and every
2-pt statistics to each other or we could use data reduction techniques
in a way to look at the data sets as a whole.

.. code:: python

    from pymks import MKSStructureAnalysis
    from pymks import PrimitiveBasis
    from sklearn.decomposition import KernelPCA
    
    reducer = KernelPCA(n_components=7, kernel='rbf')
    prim_basis = PrimitiveBasis(2)
    analyzer = MKSStructureAnalysis(prim_basis, correlations=[(1, 0)],
                                    dimension_reducer=reducer)
    analyzer.fit(X_seg)


.. code:: python

    from pymks.tools import draw_components_scatter
    
    
    draw_components_scatter(np.array_split(analyzer.reduced_fit_data[:, :3], 3),
                            ['group A', 'group B', 'group C'], legend_outside=True)




.. image:: metallic_glass_files/metallic_glass_12_0.png


It looks like there is an outliner in our dataset. Let's look

.. code:: python

    draw_microstructures(X[27:28])



.. image:: metallic_glass_files/metallic_glass_14_0.png


This images had a much larger magnification than the others...

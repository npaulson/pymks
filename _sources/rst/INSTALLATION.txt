Installation
============

Conda
-----

Conda is the easiest way to install PyMKS. To install use

::

    $ conda config --add channels pymks
    $ conda install pymks

Pip
---

The following steps outline the necessary requirements for a successful
installation of PyMKS.

Use pip,

::

    $ pip install pymks

and then run the tests.

::

    $ python -c "import pymks; pymks.test()"

Scipy Stack
-----------

Both `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__ and
`Numpy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__ as well as
`Scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org>`__ are required.

Testing
-------

The package `Pytest <https://pytest.org>`__ is required for testing
only. Use

::

    $ py.test

in the base directory or

::

    $ python -c "import pymks; pymks.test()"

to run all the tests.

Examples
--------

To use the interactive examples from the ``notebooks/`` directory,
IPython and Matplotlib are both required.

`SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`__
----------------------------

PyMKS can be used without `SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`__, but many of the
tests and examples require `SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`__ to generate the
sample data so it is a good idea to install it.

To install `SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`__, first clone with

::

    $ git clone git://github.com/sfepy/sfepy.git

and then install with

::

    $ cd sfepy
    $ python setup.py install

See the `SfePy installation
instructions <http://sfepy.org/doc-devel/installation.html>`__ for more
details.

`PyFFTW <http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/>`__
------------------------------------------------

If installed, PyMKS will use
`PyFFTW <http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/>`__ to compute FFTs instead
of `Numpy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__. As long as
`Numpy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__ is not using `Intel
MKL <https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/numpyscipy-with-intel-mkl>`__,
`PyFFTW <http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/>`__ should improve the
performance of PyMKS.

To install `PyFFTW <http://hgomersall.github.io/pyFFTW/>`__ use pip

::

    $ pip install pyfftw

See the `PyFFTW installation
instructions <https://github.com/hgomersall/pyFFTW#installation>`__ for
more details.

Installation on Windows
-----------------------

We recommend you download and install the `Anaconda Python
Distribution <http://continuum.io/downloads>`__ for Python 2.7 (x64) and
then download and install PyMKS, using the `windows
installer <https://github.com/materialsinnovation/pymks/releases/download/version-0_2_1/PyMKS-x64-anaconda27.exe>`__.

Installation on Mac OS X
------------------------

We recommend you download and install the `Anaconda Python
Distribution <http://continuum.io/downloads>`__ for Python 2.7 (x64).
Once Anaconda has been installed, follow the above procedures to install
SfePy. Finally, install PyMKS using ``pip`` as described above.

Installation with Anaconda
--------------------------

The `Anaconda Python
Distributionn <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`__ contains
all of the required packages outside of `SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`__ and
works on multiple platforms.
`Download <http://continuum.io/downloads>`__ and
`install <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html>`__ Anaconda,
and use your terminal or shell to install PyMKS using pip.

Requirements
------------

The `REQUIREMENTS.md <REQUIREMENTS.html>`__ file has a list of required
packages in a Python environment used to run tests and examples for the
current release of PyMKS.

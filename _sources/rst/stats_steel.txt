Low Carbon Steel Optical Micrographs
====================================

Introduction
------------

This page is an example of how to obtain 2-point statistics using PyMKS
tools. The workflow is the following: import image dataset, display the
images, threshold the images if necessary, and calculate 2-point
statistics for the images.

First, we will go through the process of calculating 2-point statistics
on the full-size images at different magnifications and then perform the
same procedure on cropped versions of the original images. Since
sometimes images are very large, and we want to crop them to reduce the
effort of computing the 2-point statistics.

The dataset that we are importing is optical micrographs of chemically
etched low carbon steel. It is etched to display some features of the
microstructure, which otherwise would not be visible.

Load Data
---------

First we are going to import the image dataset.

.. code:: python

    %matplotlib inline
    %load_ext autoreload
    %autoreload 2


.. code:: python

    from pymks_share import DataManager
    
    
    manager = DataManager ('pymks.me.gatech.edu')
    X = manager.fetch_data('Low-Carbon Steel Optical Micrographs')


Now, we will display the images using the PyMKS ``draw_microstructure``
tool.

.. code:: python

    import skimage.io as io
    import matplotlib.pylab as plt
    import numpy as np
    from pymks.tools import draw_microstructures
    
    
    draw_microstructures(X)




.. image:: stats_steel_files/stats_steel_6_0.png


The images were taken at different magnifications (increasing left to
right), 50x, 100x, 200x, 500x, and 500x with higher exposure value.
Although the images were obtained using the same equipment, there are
some variations in brightness, contrast, exposure, etc., to account for
variation in image collection process.

Image Segmentation
------------------

The imported images are in grayscale. We need to make them black and
white, since we know that there are only two different particles in the
microstructure. We do this by thresholding the image using Otsu's
method. By thresholding, each pixel in the image will become either
black or white, giving us only 2 local states.

.. code:: python

    from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu
    
    
    X_thresh = np.array([threshold_otsu(x) for x in X])
    X_binary = X > X_thresh[:, None, None]


.. code:: python

    draw_microstructures(X[2:4,:,:])
    draw_microstructures(X_binary[2:4,:,:])



.. image:: stats_steel_files/stats_steel_10_0.png



.. image:: stats_steel_files/stats_steel_10_1.png


We plotted two original images at 200x (top left) and 500x (top right)
to compare with their thresholded image (bottom). The original images
have 256 shades of gray and the thresholded images have only two shades,
0 or 1, seen in the scale bar.

In the original images, we can clearly see grain boundaries, whereas in
the thresholded images, some of the grain boundaries are removed from
the image, better seen in the 500x image (bottom right).

2-Point Statistics
------------------

Now we are going to compute correlations using PyMKS ``correlate`` tool,
which computes auto- and cross-correlations for all phases in the
microstructure. We have 2 phases in our microstructure ``n_states=2``.

.. code:: python

    from pymks.stats import correlate
    from pymks import PrimitiveBasis
    
    
    prim_basis = PrimitiveBasis(n_states=2)
    X_corr = correlate(X_binary, prim_basis, periodic_axes=(0,1))
    print("Shape of X_corr")
    print(X_corr.shape)



.. parsed-literal::

    Shape of X_corr
    (5, 520, 694, 3)


After computing the correlations we have three correlation results for
each of our 5 microstructures. Note that the array of each correlation
plot is the same as the original image. For each image we obtain 3
correlation plots.

We will plot the 2-point statistics below.

.. code:: python

    from pymks.tools import draw_correlations
    
    
    for x in X_corr:
        draw_correlations(x, correlations=[(1, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2)])
        x_center = (X_corr.shape[1] + 1) / 2
        y_center = (X_corr.shape[2] + 1) / 2
        print('Volume fraction of black phase')
        print(x[x_center, y_center, 0])
        print('Volume fraction of white phase')
        print(x[x_center, y_center, 1])




.. image:: stats_steel_files/stats_steel_14_0.png


.. parsed-literal::

    Volume fraction of black phase
    0.394543879546
    Volume fraction of white phase

    0.282115929406
    Volume fraction of white phase

.. parsed-literal::

    Volume fraction of black phase
    0.202374743859
    Volume fraction of white phase
    0.797625222784



.. image:: stats_steel_files/stats_steel_14_6.png


.. parsed-literal::

    Volume fraction of black phase
    0.199789397016
    Volume fraction of white phase
    0.800210569628



.. image:: stats_steel_files/stats_steel_14_8.png


.. parsed-literal::

    Volume fraction of black phase
    0.174321098153
    Volume fraction of white phase
    0.82567886849


The above plots indicate the states on which the 2-point statistics have
been calculated (black-black, white-white, black-white). In this case,
the black phase is labelled as 1 and white phase as 2. The grain pattern
in the original images seem random and the grain shapes are different.
From the correlation plots, we cannot tell any microstructure features
or patterns that clearly stand out.

We can focus on the volume fractions for each image. For images at
highest magnification (500x) the volume fraction of the black phase is
minimum at 17.4%, and at lowest magnification (50x), it is 39.5%.

The difference in volume fraction is because the lower magnification
images retained a higher amount of grain boundary information in the
image after thresholding. Grain boundary information is not desirable
since it is not part of a particular phase. A grain boundary can
separate two phases that appear white, and the statistics treat the
grain boundary as a black phase, which will not be accurate.

Since we see less grain boundaries in the higher magnification images
(500x), these images are more reliable for computing 2-point statistics.
The images with 500x show a volume fraction of black phase of 20.0% and
17.4%. The image of 200x shows a volume fraction of 20.2%, which is in
good agreement with the statistics of 500x images compared to 50x and
100x, 39.5% and 28.2%, respectively.

The volume fractions vary slightly in 200x and 500x images, which is
expected since the images were taken at different locations. However,
the etched images at higher magnification are more reliable for
2-statistics since they do include as much grain boundary information as
the lower magnification images.

2-Point Statistics on Cropped Images
------------------------------------

Now we are going to crop the image to the first 300 pixels in horizontal
and vertical directions and repeat the process of computing the 2-point
statistics. Our new images are going to be 300x300 pixels.

.. code:: python

    X_crop = X[:,0:250,0:250]
    print('Shape of X')
    print(X_crop.shape)
    draw_microstructures(X_crop)



.. parsed-literal::

    Shape of X
    (5, 250, 250)



.. image:: stats_steel_files/stats_steel_17_1.png


.. code:: python

    X_thresh = np.array([threshold_otsu(x) for x in X_crop])
    X_binary_crop = X_crop > X_thresh[:, None, None]
        
    draw_microstructures(X_binary_crop)




.. image:: stats_steel_files/stats_steel_18_0.png


.. code:: python

    prim_basis = PrimitiveBasis(n_states=2)
    X_corr_crop = correlate(X_binary_crop, prim_basis, periodic_axes=(0,1))
    
    for x in X_corr_crop:
        draw_correlations(x, correlations=[(1, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2)])
        x_center = (X_corr_crop.shape[1] + 1) / 2
        y_center = (X_corr_crop.shape[2] + 1) / 2
        print('Volume fraction of black phase')
        print(x[x_center, y_center, 0])
        print('Volume fraction of white phase')
        print(x[x_center, y_center, 1])

We have computed the 2-point statistics for the cropped images. The
volume fractions for cropped images are very close to the volume
fractions of the original resolution images, within 5% difference.

At higher resolution images (500x) we can now better observe the
distribution of the black and white phases. For example, in 2-point
statistics result for last image, we can see the distribution of the
black and white phases in a diagonal direction. It is not so evident for
lower magnification images.

We now have more meaningful 2-point statistics plots for the cropped
images at higher magnifications (200x, 500x). However, for lower
magnification images we do not yet have insightful spatial correlations.
To improve the spatial statistics for 50x and 100x, we can crop the
images further, which will approximately match the view field of the
higher magnification images.

Spatial correlations are a more rigorous way to analyze microstructure
images rather than using intuition and expertise. It is important to
have an image with a view field that is representative of the whole
microstructure for 2-point statistics computations. Once two point
statistics have been computed for a dataset, the spatial correlations
can by further analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). This
can easily be done with either the ``MKSStructureAnalysis`` or if you
have a material property you would like to correlate the microstructure
with you can use ``MKSHomogenizationModel``.
